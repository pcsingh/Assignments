> python tsp.py 
---
**Output:**

```
How many cities do you want to generate: 8

Coordinates:
City 0 has coordinate [15, 16]
City 1 has coordinate [12, 91]
City 2 has coordinate [79, 34]
City 3 has coordinate [33, 59]
City 4 has coordinate [52, 24]
City 5 has coordinate [78, 92]
City 6 has coordinate [69, 85]
City 7 has coordinate [53, 96]

Initial state to travel:  ['0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '0'] 

Initial distance was 447.39 km. 

Final state (optimized) to travel:  ['0', '4', '3', '1', '2', '6', '7', '5', '0'] 

Optimized distance is 399.34 km.
